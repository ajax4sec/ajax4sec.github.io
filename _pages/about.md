<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am now an Associate Professor in Purui Su's group in Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS). And I am CCF Senior Member, CAAI Member, ACM Member, and IEEE Member.

I obtained my B.E. degree in Information Security from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2012. During college, I was transferred to Feng Chia University (Taiwan) in 2010.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the TCA lab at <a href="http://english.is.cas.cn/"> Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) </a> in 2012-2018,
was co-advised by Professor <a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~purui"> Purui Su </a> and Professor <a href="https://casad.cas.cn/ysxx2022/ysmd/xxjs/201911/t20191121_4724697.html"> Dengguo Feng </a>. After, I worked as a Postdoc at the Software Systems Security lab headed by Professor <a href="https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/wu/">Dinghao Wu</a> in The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in 2018-2019.<br>

<p>
My research interests focus on <b> software engineering and software security</b>.
I am now working on several projects supported by NSFC, CAS, and companies (e.g., Huawei and Ant Group), including:

<ul>
<li><b>Dynamic program analysis</b></li>                  
<li><b>Vulnerability discovery based on fuzzing</b></li>
<li><b>Patch analysis and software supply chain security</b></li>
</ul>
